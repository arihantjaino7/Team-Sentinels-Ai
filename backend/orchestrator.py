"""Coordinates one scan: normalize the URL, run every agent, build a ScanReport.

All five agents run concurrently via `asyncio.gather` — the whole scan takes
about as long as the slowest single agent, not the sum of all five. Adding a
sixth agent later means one more line in `AGENTS` below; nothing else here
changes for it.

Two ways to run a scan, sharing the same agents and the same final report
logic (`_finalize`), differing only in *when the caller finds out about each
result*:

- `run_scan` — used by `POST /scan`. Waits for all five, returns one
  complete `ScanReport`. Simple; the right shape for `curl` and any client
  that just wants an answer.
- `run_scan_stream` — used by `GET /scan/stream` (A16). Yields each
  `AgentResult` the instant it finishes, in real completion order, then a
  final `ScanReport` once everything's done. Same concurrency as
  `run_scan` — every agent is still started at once — the only difference
  is the caller stops having to wait for the slowest agent before hearing
  about the fastest one.
