"""Fetches a public GitHub repository as a tarball and extracts it to a
temporary directory, with hard limits so an oversized or hostile repo can
never turn into a disk-fill, decompression-bomb, or path-traversal problem
for this machine.

Two entry points:

- `parse_github_url` -- turn whatever a user typed into (owner, repo, ref).
  Mirrors `orchestrator.normalize_url`'s exact contract (strip, reject
  empty, prepend a scheme if missing, then raise ValueError on anything
  unusable) so `main.py` can convert it to a 400 with the same one-line
  `except ValueError` it already has for URL scans.
- `fetch_repo` -- an async context manager. Downloads the repo's tarball,
  extracts it into a fresh temp directory, yields that directory, then
  deletes it on the way out -- success or failure, via `finally`.

CONVENTIONS.md's repo-side non-negotiable applies here more than anywhere else in
this codebase: this only ever reads bytes out of the tarball. Nothing here
imports, installs, or executes a single line of the scanned repo's code.
