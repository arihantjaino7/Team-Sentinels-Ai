    PASS findings cost nothing — only FAIL and WARN represent an actual
    problem (see Status in models.py). Beyond that, three rules apply, in
    order, so eight agents can never charge for the same problem twice:

    1. **Dedup.** Findings are grouped by `_issue_key` (canonical id + host);
       only the highest-severity finding in each group survives.
    2. **Alias collapse** (part of `_issue_key`, via `ALIASES`) folds a new
       agent's name for an old problem onto the old id, so a subdomain
       finding about the apex host collapses onto the headers agent's
       finding about the same host.
    3. **Repeat decay + per-agent cap.** The same surviving `base_id` seen on
       many different hosts is one operational mistake, not N of them: the
       1st occurrence (in a fixed, agent-order-independent sort) costs full
       price, the 2nd-3rd cost half, the 4th+ cost nothing. Separately, the
       three v4 attack-surface agents (`api-security`, `subdomain`,
       `misconfig`) may each deduct at most `AGENT_PENALTY_CAP` points in
       total — pre-v4 agents are never capped.

    For the five pre-v4 agents this is a no-op: each emits one finding per
    id, all on the apex host with `affected_url=None`, so every issue key is
    already unique — dedup keeps everything, decay never triggers (nothing
    repeats), and none of them are in the capped set. The score for a
    five-agent scan is therefore identical to before this function existed.
