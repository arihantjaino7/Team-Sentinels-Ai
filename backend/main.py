# The browser treats http://localhost:3000 (the Next.js frontend) and
# http://localhost:8000 (this API) as different origins — same host, different
# port is enough — and by default refuses to let JavaScript on one read a
# response from the other. This middleware sends the headers that grant that
# permission explicitly.
#
# Listing the two dev origins rather than allow_origins=["*"] is deliberate:
# a wildcard would let a page on *any* site drive this API using the visitor's
# machine as the source of the scan traffic. For a tool that makes outbound
# requests to third-party sites, that's a genuinely bad default to ship.
#
# allow_credentials=True (PLAN-v5 Stage 0) is what lets the browser attach the
# session cookie to a cross-port request at all — without it the cookie is
# silently dropped and every protected route looks like it's rejecting a
# signed-in user. The two are a package deal in the CORS spec: a wildcard
# origin and allow_credentials cannot be combined, which is one more reason
# the explicit two-origin list above was already the right call.
#
# Deployed, the frontend lives on its own domain rather than localhost:3000 —
# `get_frontend_origin()` already reads SENTINELS_FRONTEND_ORIGIN for the
# post-login redirect, so the same value is reused here rather than adding a
# second env var that could drift out of sync with it.

#
# Locally the frontend (localhost:3000) and backend (localhost:8000) are
# same-site, so samesite="lax" with no `secure` flag works over plain HTTP.
# Deployed, frontend and backend sit on two different domains — every
# fetch() call becomes cross-site, and SameSite=Lax cookies are not sent on
# cross-site fetch/XHR (only on top-level navigation, which is why the OAuth
# redirect itself would still appear to succeed while every API call after
