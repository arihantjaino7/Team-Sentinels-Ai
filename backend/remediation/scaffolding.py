"""Two creates-only fixers for agents/repo/hygiene.py findings that have no
`file_path` at all -- they're "is X present anywhere" checks, not
line-level ones.

`ReadmeFixer` (`repo-readme-present`) -- adds a starter `README.md` when
none of hygiene.py's own recognized README names exist.

`EnvExampleFixer` (`repo-env-example-present`) -- adds `.env.example` with
every key from a committed `.env`, values blanked. Deliberately refuses to
plan anything when no `.env` exists to read keys from: inventing plausible
env-var names would be a guess dressed up as a fact, exactly what
CONVENTIONS.md's confidence rule forbids. (A committed `.env` is *also* a
`secret-env-committed-*` finding -- Tier 2, no Fixer in this stage -- so a
repo that trips this path already has a separate, correctly-tiered warning
about the file this fixer is reading from.)
