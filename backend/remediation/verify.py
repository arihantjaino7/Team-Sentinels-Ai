"""Re-run one agent against the repository as it is *now*, and report what
actually changed (PLAN-v5 Stage C).

This module exists because of one line in CONVENTIONS.md: "Never report a fix as
working on the strength of having written it." Stage A produced a diff, Stage B
turned it into a merged pull request — and neither of those is evidence that
the finding is gone. The only evidence is looking again.

So the shape of this file is deliberately narrow:

  * it re-downloads the repository and re-runs **one** agent, the one whose
    slug is stored on the finding being verified — not the whole scan;
  * it never writes a new `scans` row and never touches the original report,
    which is immutable history (PLAN-v5.md conflict #6);
  * the score comes out of the untouched deterministic
    `scoring.calculate_score`, called twice over two lists of findings. No
    model is anywhere near it, and this module does not compute a score itself.

The one write it performs is to the audit trail: the `fix_applications` row for
this finding moves to `verified` and keeps the result as its evidence.
