"""The exact words of the branch name, commit message, PR title, and PR body.

All of it built by string formatting from data already on the `Finding` and
`FixPlan`. No model writes any of it — a pull request body is a claim about
what the code does, and CONVENTIONS.md's remediation rule 1 does not have an
exception for prose that happens to sit next to a diff.

Rule 9 is the reason this file exists at all rather than being three f-strings
inside `apply.py`: **every PR says what it does not fix**, and the most
important instance of that is secret removal. Deleting a committed secret from
the working tree does not rotate the credential and does not remove it from
git history — anyone with the repository still has it. A PR that quietly
implied otherwise would be actively dangerous, so the caveat is assembled
from the same table that decides which fixer ran, not left to whoever writes
the next fixer to remember.
