"""ID-prefix -> fixability tier lookup (docs/PLAN-v5.md's "Fixability tiers"
table). Tier is a property of the *finding type*, not of whether a Fixer
happens to exist for it -- most tier-3 and every tier-4 finding never gets
a Fixer at all; this table is what a UI badge reads even then.

| Tier | Meaning                              | UI reads              |
|------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 1    | Deterministic, safe to PR             | Fix available          |
| 2    | Generated, human must check           | Review required        |
| 3    | We can say what to do, can't do it    | Manual action required |
| 4    | Never auto-fix                        | Suggestion only        |
