"""The one place in Sentinels that writes to somebody's repository.

Everything else in `remediation/` produces text: a diff, a summary, a PR body.
This module is where that text becomes a branch and a pull request, so every
rule that governs the feature is enforced here, in one readable sequence,
rather than spread across the modules it calls.

The order below is deliberate and is the order in `docs/PLAN-v5.md`. Every
check that can reject the request runs *before* the first byte is written, so
a rejected apply is always a no-op — there is no half-applied state to
explain or clean up. The single exception is a pull request that fails to open
after the branch already exists, and that case deletes the branch it made.

`dry_run=True` runs every check and stops immediately before the first write.
It exists so that "would this work?" can be answered without hoping.

The two invariants signed off in PLAN-v5 Stage B, stated once:

  **#3 Strict ownership.** The scan must belong to the caller. Unlike
  `DELETE /scans/{id}`, an unowned legacy scan is *not* fair game — there is
  no one whose installation it would even use.

  **#4 Installation ownership, checked separately.** A live
  `github_installations` row belonging to the caller, on the account that owns
  the target repository. Passing one check never implies the other.
