"""How Sentinels gets permission to write to a repository, for one hour at a
time (PLAN-v5 Stage B).

Sign-in (`auth/github_oauth.py`) answers "who is this person". It deliberately
throws its access token away, because knowing who you are does not require
standing permission to act as you. This module answers the *other* question:
"may this program push a branch to that repository right now" -- and it never
holds a long-lived credential to do it either.

The chain, and why each link exists:

  1. The App has an RSA **private key**, a file that lives outside the repo and
     is never sent anywhere. Not a password -- a signing key.
  2. Sentinels signs a short **JWT** with it. A JWT is just three
     base64 chunks joined by dots -- header, claims, signature -- and the
     signature is what makes it unforgeable. Claims here are only `iss` (which
     App), `iat`, and `exp`. Nine minutes, because GitHub rejects anything over
     ten and clocks drift.
  3. That JWT proves "I am the Sentinels App" and nothing more. It cannot read
     or write a single file. It can only be traded, at
     `POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens`, for...
  4. ...an **installation token**: a real credential, scoped to exactly the
     repositories that one installation covers, with exactly the permissions
     the App declared, expiring in about an hour.

The whole point of the shape is step 3. The credential that lasts forever
(the private key) cannot touch a repository, and the credential that can touch
a repository does not last.

A tiny standalone version of the same idea, no GitHub involved:

    def day_pass(master_key, room):
        return f"{room}-pass-valid-1h"      # derived, narrow, expiring

    # the master key opens the safe that prints passes -- never a door

`DevTokenProvider` exists because doing steps 1-4 for the first time is a
multi-step setup, and it should be possible to test the *Git* half before the
*auth* half is registered. It refuses to run without an explicit opt-in
environment variable, so it can never be what's running by accident.
