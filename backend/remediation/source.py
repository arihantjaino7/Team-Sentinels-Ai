"""Fetches a single file's *current* content and blob SHA straight from
GitHub's Contents API -- the drift anchor a `FixPlan`'s diff is built
against, and the same value Stage B (unimplemented here) re-checks
immediately before ever writing anything (CONVENTIONS.md's remediation rule 7,
"Drift aborts").

Deliberately independent of `repo/fetch.py`'s tarball: that tarball is
deleted the moment a scan finishes (its own docstring says so), and it
never carried a per-file blob SHA anyway -- a tarball is a flat archive, not
`git` objects. The Contents API is the one unauthenticated GitHub endpoint
that hands back a blob SHA for a single path without a full clone.

`FileSource` is what a `Fixer.plan()` actually holds -- one bound to a
specific (owner, repo, ref) so fixers never see a raw `httpx.AsyncClient` or
construct a GitHub URL themselves.
