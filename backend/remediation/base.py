"""The contract every deterministic fixer must satisfy -- the remediation-side
sibling of `agents/base.py` / `agents/repo/base.py`.

A `Fixer` never invents a patch. `plan()` is plain, deterministic Python
working off content this process fetched itself through `FileSource`
(CONVENTIONS.md's remediation rule 1: "The LLM never generates a security
patch"). Given the same finding and the same repo state, it always produces
the same `FixPlan` -- or the same `None`, when there's nothing left to fix.
