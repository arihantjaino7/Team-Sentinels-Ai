"""Creating a branch, a commit, and a pull request without ever cloning the
repository (PLAN-v5 Stage B).

Git's object model is four kinds of thing, and GitHub exposes an endpoint per
kind. Understanding the four is the whole of this file:

  **blob**  — one file's bytes. No name, no path; just content and a SHA.
  **tree**  — a directory listing: names, modes, and the SHAs they point at.
  **commit**— a pointer to one tree, plus a parent, an author, a message.
  **ref**   — a *movable* name, like `refs/heads/main`, pointing at a commit.

A commit made by hand follows exactly that order, bottom-up: upload the new
file contents, describe the directory that contains them, wrap that in a
commit, then point a new branch name at it. Nothing overwrites anything —
each step creates a new immutable object, and only the last step (the ref)
introduces a name anyone will see.

A tiny standalone version of the same idea, no git involved:

    contents = {"a1": "hello"}          # blobs, keyed by content id
    listing  = {"greeting.txt": "a1"}   # a tree
    snapshot = {"tree": listing, "parent": None, "msg": "first"}
    branches = {"main": snapshot}       # a ref: a name pointing at a snapshot

`base_tree` is the one subtlety worth stating outright. Passing it means "the
repository as it already is, with these paths replaced" — without it, the new
tree would be the *only* thing in the commit, and the pull request would show
every other file in the repository as deleted.

Everything here is scoped by CONVENTIONS.md's remediation rules 4 and 5: create a
`sentinels/…` ref, never touch an existing one, never push to a default
branch, never merge, never force.
