"""AI analyst — turns a scan's findings into a short plain-English summary.

M12 refactored this to use ai/client.py and ai/prompts.py. R10 (PLAN-v3)
added the `target_type` parameter below so the same function serves both
scan types — every existing caller that omits it keeps getting the original
URL-flavoured summary, unchanged. Graceful-degradation contract is
unchanged: "" when no key or any failure.
