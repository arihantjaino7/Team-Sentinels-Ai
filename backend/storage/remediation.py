"""Read/write path for the three remediation tables: `fix_plans` (Stage A),

a pull request).

The one thing to know about `fix_applications`: it stores its own frozen
`plan_json` rather than trusting `fix_plan_id` to still describe what was
applied. `fix_plans` is replaced wholesale on every re-plan, so the row a
foreign key points at can become a *different* patch — or disappear. An audit
record whose meaning changes underneath it is not an audit record
