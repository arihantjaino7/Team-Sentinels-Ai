"""Read/write path for `github_installations` -- the table that says which
user granted Sentinels write access to which GitHub account.

The table has existed since Stage 0's migration 10 but nothing read or wrote
it (PLAN-v5.md conflict #10). Stage B is what finally needs it: an
installation token can only be minted against an installation id, and
`remediation/apply.py` will not mint one unless the row backing it belongs to
the user making the request.

`revoked_at` is a *soft* revoke. Sentinels stopping is not the same as GitHub
stopping -- the real revocation happens on github.com, whenever the user
chooses. Writing a timestamp here means "we will no longer use this", which is
the only half of it Sentinels actually controls.
