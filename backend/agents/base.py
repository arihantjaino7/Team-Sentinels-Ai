"""The contract every scanner agent must satisfy.

Two pieces:

- `ScanContext` — everything an agent needs to do its job, built once per scan
  and passed to all agents. Keeps agents from each opening their own
  connections or re-deriving the target URL.
- `BaseAgent` — an abstract base class. Subclasses implement `scan()` only;
  `run()` is inherited as-is and gives every agent, for free, the guarantee
  from CONVENTIONS.md: "agents must never crash the scan."
