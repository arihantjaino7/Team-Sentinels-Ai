"""The contract every repo-scanner agent must satisfy -- the repo-side
sibling of `agents/base.py`.

Three pieces:

- `RepoFile` / `RepoContext` -- everything a repo agent needs, built once per
  scan and passed to every agent. The file tree is walked exactly once here,
  the same instinct as `ScanContext` sharing one `httpx.AsyncClient` instead
  of every agent opening its own connection.
- `BaseRepoAgent` -- an abstract base class. Deliberately a standalone class,
  not a shared/generic subclass of `BaseAgent`: the `context` parameter's
  type genuinely differs (`RepoContext` vs `ScanContext`), and this
  codebase's own convention -- five near-identical per-check agent files
  rather than one parametrized mega-agent -- already favors this kind of
  small duplication over a premature `Generic[T]` base. `run()` copies
  `BaseAgent.run()`'s crash-proofing logic verbatim: every agent must never
  crash the scan (CONVENTIONS.md), repo agents included.
