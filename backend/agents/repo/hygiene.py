"""The repo Hygiene agent -- checks for basic project-hygiene signals: is
there a README/LICENSE, is the lockfile committed alongside the manifest,
are there any tests, is CI configured, is an .env example provided, and are
there any suspiciously large files sitting in the repo.

R2 shipped this class with just the README/LICENSE pair, deliberately, as
"one trivial agent to prove the repo-agent wiring end to end" with a real,
useful check rather than a no-op placeholder. R8 (Phase R-B) extends that
same class with the rest of PLAN-v3's hygiene checks instead of creating a
second file -- these are all "does this repo have X" checks of the same
shape, just more of them.
