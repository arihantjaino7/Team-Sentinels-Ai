"""The Exposure agent — checks for a small, fixed list of well-known
sensitive paths being accidentally served publicly.

CONVENTIONS.md's scope rule sets the boundary for what this agent is allowed to
do: a couple of GET requests to specific, well-known, publicly-fetchable
paths, checked against what their real content looks like — never a
wordlist, never a guessing attack, never anything resembling brute force.
"safely" (per the roadmap) also means never echoing back whatever secrets a
real exposure might contain — see `_check_env_file` below.
