"""Coordinates one repo scan -- the repo-side sibling of `orchestrator.py`.

Same shape as the URL orchestrator on purpose: parse the target, fetch/walk
it once, run every registered agent concurrently via `asyncio.gather`, then
hand the combined findings to the *same* `scoring.py` / `checklist/evaluator.py`
/ `ai/analyst.py` / `storage/scans.py` every URL scan already uses (PLAN-v3's
"extend, don't fork" architecture note). Only fetching and the agents
themselves are genuinely repo-specific.

`run_repo_scan` was pulled forward from its originally-planned home in R11
(the frontend/streaming milestone) because R9's own verification bar --
"scan the same repo twice, checklist and readiness must be identical" --
can't be checked without a real end-to-end repo scan to run twice. R11 still
owns the streaming variant (`GET /repo/stream`, mirroring `scan_stream`) and
the frontend that calls it; this module just gives R9 (and R10 after it)
something real to verify against, the same way `docs/PLAN-v3.md`'s "Resume
here" note anticipated.
