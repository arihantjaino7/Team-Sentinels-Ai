"""The dependency every protected route hangs off.

FastAPI's `Depends` runs a function before the route body and hands the result
in as an argument. Written once here, `Depends(current_user)` on a route means
"this endpoint does not exist for anyone who isn't signed in" — the route body
never runs, so it cannot forget to check.

A tiny standalone shape of the same idea, no FastAPI involved:

    def needs_ticket(check):
        def wrapper():
            holder = check()          # raises if there's no valid ticket
            return f"welcome, {holder}"
        return wrapper

The check happens outside the thing being protected, so the protected thing
has no way to skip it.
