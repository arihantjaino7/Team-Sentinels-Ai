"""SQLite connection and schema management.

Stdlib `sqlite3`, no ORM — the query surface across the whole v2 plan is
small (~12 queries total), so an ORM would be a dependency for a problem
that doesn't need one. This also keeps Sentinels at zero new third-party
dependencies for persistence.

Migrations are just an ordered list of (version, sql) pairs applied in
order past whatever `schema_version` currently holds. M1 only ships
version 1 (scans, agent_runs, findings); later milestones (M4, M9, M13,
M15) append further versions here rather than editing this one.

# an already-applied finding would silently delete its `fix_applications` row,
# destroying the record of a PR that might still be open or already merged.

# Two changes fix that, and one enforces idempotency:
#
#   1. `plan_json` -- an immutable snapshot of the exact FixPlan that was applied.
#      The audit record now carries its own copy of what happened, so it stays
#      complete even if `fix_plans` changes or the row disappears entirely.
#   2. `fix_plan_id` becomes nullable with ON DELETE SET NULL -- a convenient
#      pointer at the live plan, never a dependency.
#   3. A *partial* unique index (the `WHERE` clause) -- SQLite only indexes rows
#      matching it, so a scan can hold many failed/abandoned attempts for one
#      finding but only ever one live application. This is the DB-level backstop
