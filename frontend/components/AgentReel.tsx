   Geometry.

   The plate is a window with its LEFT EDGE PINNED. Only its width changes, so
   it opens rightwards and closes back leftwards — it never grows from its
   centre. The artwork inside is a fixed size and never resizes; it is simply
   too wide for the plate at rest, so the plate crops its right edge, and it
   slides right as the plate opens.

   Two consequences fall out of that and are the whole point:

     · the artwork un-crops as the plate opens, which is what "pops out"
     · the text sits after the plate in normal flow, so widening the plate
       pushes the text right and narrowing it pulls the text back left.
       The text has no animation of its own at all.

   `PLATE_VW` below is duplicated in the plate's own Tailwind class further
   down (`lg:w-[36vw]`) and the two have to agree: GSAP animates away from
   the width CSS gives the plate, so if they drift the plate visibly jumps
   on the first scroll. The plate's height (`lg:h-[34vw]`) and the artwork's
   width (`lg:w-[38vw]`) are plain CSS with nothing to keep in sync — neither
   is read by any function here.

   still downloading, so each one is that texture's own mean colour rather than
   a hand-picked shade. The plate therefore never flashes a colour the texture
   is about to replace with something different.
