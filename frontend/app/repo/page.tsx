/* The repository launcher — the route the GitHub card leads to.

   The repo-side sibling of `app/url/page.tsx`: same shell, same
   `ScanLauncher`, only `targetType="repo"` differs — which is what tells
   `ScanLauncher` to stream from `/repo/stream` instead of `/scan/stream`
   and `ScanProgress` to show the five repo agents instead of the five URL
   agents. `docs/PLAN-v3.md` R11 reserves this path deliberately top-level
   (`/repo`, not `/scan/repo`, which the `/scan/[scanId]` dynamic segment
   would swallow). The landing page's GitHub card already points here and
   needed zero changes when this landed. */
